    <h1>Meet the Chaos Crew</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the lineup of legends — the girls who made college life way more colorful, chaotic, and comical. Each one has their quirks, their charm, and their <i>main character</i> moments. So here’s your guide to the squad that keeps the drama high and the vibes even higher.</p>

  <h2>Sanjana – The Storyteller in Sweaters</h2>
  <p>At 19, Sanjana is the warm hug of the group — calm, clever, and always lost in some bookish universe. Born and brought up in Bangalore, she made the leap back to her roots last year, and oh boy, has it been a ride. Culture shocks, language switches, nostalgic realizations — she’s loving every bit of it.</p>
  <p>A total bookworm, Sanjana is the girl who has at least <i>three</i> novels in her bag at all times and still complains she has nothing to read. She’s obsessed with Haruki Murakami’s dreamlike chaos and loves detective novels so much, she practically plays Sherlock in her head — guessing plot twists before they even unfold. Spoiler alert: she’s usually right.</p>
  <p>When she’s not nose-deep in a mystery, she’s watching movies with plotlines you have to <i>think</i> about (no basic rom-coms, please). She’s not super fluent in Malayalam — yet — but she’s learning with heart and humor. She messes up, a lot, but her friends patiently cheer her on as she stumbles through new words, always with a sheepish grin.</p>
  <p>She’s quiet in the loudest way, expressive in silences, and thoughtful enough to write everyone’s biography if she wanted to — and honestly? She just might.</p>

  <h2>Pavithra – Tiny but Terrifying</h2>
  <p>She’s 18, 5 feet of aesthetic chaos, and walks like she owns the hallway. Pavitra is cute, yes. Sweet? Sometimes. But underestimate her and she’ll have you emotionally demolished with one sentence and a smirk. The duality is insane.</p>
  <p>Her personality is Lana Del Rey meets “don’t talk to me till I’ve had coffee.” Horror movies? Her comfort genre. Except… she doesn’t just <i>like</i> them. She studies them like she’s preparing for a zombie apocalypse. Her favorite? <b>Saw</b>. Of course it is. She finds peace in chaos.</p>
  <p>Pavithra also dabbles in art — sometimes she’ll show up with a sketch that looks straight out of a gallery and other times she’s like “ugh it’s trash,” and throws it in her bag. Classic. She's unpredictable, a little wicked, and absolutely unforgettable.</p>

  <h2>Aafia – The Daydream Pilot</h2>
  <p>Aafia is the girl with her head in the clouds — and not just metaphorically. While the rest of us are stressing over internals, she’s mentally flying over the Burj Khalifa. With her parents based in Dubai and a dream of becoming a pilot, she’s got a passport heart and an airport soul.</p>
  <p>She’s chill, soft-spoken, and always a little spaced out — in a “thinking about runway lights” kind of way. Ask her what she wants to be, and she’ll tell you with dreamy eyes and zero hesitation: “A pilot.” During exams? She’s calculating fuel-to-weight ratios while we’re panicking about units.</p>
  <p>Afia is that calm breeze in the group, until someone mentions Dubai — then it’s game over. Full fangirl mode. We love her cloud-chasing spirit and her ability to daydream with purpose.</p>

  <h2>Jenifer – The Smart Girl Who Can Spin</h2>
  <p>If we were in a K-drama, Jenifer would be the all-rounder second lead we’d all fall in love with. Her brain? Sharp as a blade. Her CGPA? A jaw-dropping 9.7. Her memory? Scary good. She’s the reason our group projects don’t crash and burn.</p>
  <p>But don’t mistake her for just a study machine — Jenifer’s got rhythm. She slays the dance floor with the same confidence she brings to a test. And yes, she’s into K-pop, and yes, she’s tried every TikTok dance before it even trends. She’s the girl who turns her to-do list into a vibe.</p>
  <p>Basically? She's brains, beauty, and BTS-level talent wrapped into one. Don’t compete. You’ll lose.</p>

  <h2>Aiswarya – The CR with a Heart of Gold</h2>
  <p>Meet Aiswarya — the fearless class rep who keeps things running smoother than the college Wi-Fi (which, let’s be real, isn’t saying much, but still). She's of Tamil origin, but she speaks Malayalam like a pro, and she's got that perfect blend of bold leadership and absolute sweetheart energy.</p>
  <p>I met her on day one, when we both had no clue who the other was, but somewhere between confused stares and awkward intros, a friendship blossomed. Now? She’s the glue. Passionate, persistent, and always the first to stand up for what’s right — and somehow still has time to help you with your attendance sheet.</p>
  <p>She’s the mom-friend and hype-woman rolled into one. And we love her for it.</p>

  <h1 style="margin-top: 3rem;">And That’s Us</h1>
  <p>Five very different people. One amazing ride. This crew has seen chaos, concerts, caffeine meltdowns, and too many late-night study sessions. And as the semester winds down, we’re grateful for all the laughs, the meltdowns, the memories — and the unspoken group chat drama we pretend isn’t real.</p>
  <p>Here’s to everything we’ve survived — and everything we’re going to rock in the semesters ahead.</p>
